Project Leader Guide

This guide is intended to help you be successful as a project leader. 

Finding a suitable project is usually the hardest part of leading a project.

First, you need to find a project for everyone to work on. Project guidelines:
- Hosted on GitHub
- Compatible with Linux
- Not too many dependencies
- 100% free
- Has room to grow (beginners can easily make contributions)
- New language/framework/etc (something the group hasn't done yet)
- Fun and/or interesting (preferably both)

You should search GitHub for repositories in your language of choice: https://github.com/search (idea: search "game")

If you see something interesting, try to compile and run it. Be forewarned: Not all projects are easy to compile! 
Be sure to keep notes on which dependencies you had to install to get it to work.

Once you have found a project, fill out the new_project_template: 
https://github.com/ChicoTeam/team-files/blob/master/new_project_template

After filling out new_project_template, change the name and push it to the team-files repository: 
https://github.com/ChicoTeam/team-files

Send Russ a link to your new project file (what you just pushed to team-files). 
He will review it, fork the project to github/ChicoTeam and send you a response.

On the day of the meeting, be prepared to give a demonstration of the project and explain how to install it. 
You should also review the code a little so that you can answer basic questions about it.
