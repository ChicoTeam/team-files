Hi,

Thanks for joining the team!

I've sent you an invitation to join the group discussion board, which is our primary method of communication with you. If you do not receive it or have problems, please let me know.

If you haven't done so already, you should set up Git and GitHub: http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect/
Send me your GitHub username once you've created an account and I'll add you to our GitHub organization.

I also recommend installing Linux, either as a Virtual Machine, dual-boot, or primary OS. Send me a message if you need help with that.

Here are some team-related links that you should bookmark:

Thanks,

President
